            <p class="lead">Version control is the major repository for any project and its accompanying files. With version control any verified user can copy files in the repository, modify them locally, and upload them back into the repository as the newest file or a seperate file. Version control allows sharing of files with no effort at all and eliminates any problems that occur when members share, use, upload, or edit project files at the same time as other members without interrupting progress or work. Compared to manual sorting and organization of project files, version control accomplishes the same task but with more efficiency and a lot less effort by the user(s).</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system is the guidelines and safety measures that encompass any version control. It keeps track of who changed what, the time a file was changed, details what changed between the old and new files, and merge the same files to which changes were made. In the system files will be backed up without user confirmation at all times. Files can not be deleted or overwritten by accident, be it due to user malfunction or other users. On the topic of other users, any user can record their change history or contribution to the repository and even reverse all changes to a previous date and time if it is needed.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Local and remote repositories are the two types of repositories of any version control and system. Local repositories are dedicated to one and each user of the project. They are to allow users to not rely on an internet connection to work or make changes that are merely for testing purposes. The can be created by creating a new repository or copying an already made remote repository onto a user's computer. Remote repositories are the online and dedicated repositories that are on a remote server that can be shared by every member in a project or simply kept as an online backup. They are created by using software/sites such as Git.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a sort of modified distributed version control system software that focuses on creating a remote repository and accompanying version control system for every user or group that requests one. Instead of focusing on one single system, Git keeps track of and stores the data of all the remote repositories of Git users with very fast speeds to ensure satisfaction as well as having users have a local copy of the repository. Not only is Git free, but the software is efficient and trustworthy enough to have big companies such as Google and Netflix use it for their own projects. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">While there are quite a few Git commands, all are easy to learn and understand.
            <ul>
                <li>-Git init creates a new repository in Git.</li><li>-Git add proposes changes to a file.</li>
                <li>-Git commit -m 'message' applies changes to the local repository.</li><li>-Git push sends changes to a file to the remote repository.</li>
                <li>-Git branch creates a seperate directory for development.</li>
                <li>-Git checkout allows a user to switch branches.</li>
                <li>-Git pull updates a user's local repository to that of the newest commit.</li>
                <li>-Git merge combines branches into one.</li>
                <li>-Git reset is used to undo commits that are no longer needed, along with -Git revert to revert the commit that was pushed to the remote repository.</li>
                <li>And -Git fetch updates all remote branches in a user's local repository.</li>
                </ul>
                While there are much more commands in Git, these are the main ones that need to be remembered.</p>
